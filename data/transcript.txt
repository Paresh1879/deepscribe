Provider: Dr. Samantha Lee (Internal Medicine / Primary Care)
Patient: John Davis, 47 y/o male


Dr. Lee: Good morning, John. It’s good to see you again. I reviewed your chart, and I saw you’ve been dealing with that persistent cough and fatigue. How are things going this week?

Patient: Morning, Doctor. It’s been rough, honestly. The cough hasn’t improved much, and the fatigue seems worse. I’m also starting to feel some tightness in my chest, especially at night.

Dr. Lee: I’m glad you came in. Let’s talk through this carefully. Can you tell me more about this chest tightness? When did it start, and what does it feel like?

Patient: I first noticed it about a week ago. It’s not sharp pain, more like pressure. Mostly when I’m lying down. It lasts a few minutes and then goes away.

Dr. Lee: Does it radiate anywhere—like your jaw, left arm, or back?

Patient: Sometimes to my upper back, but not always. It doesn’t really go down my arm.

Dr. Lee: Does it happen with activity, like walking up stairs or carrying things?

Patient: Not usually during the day. It’s more at night or early morning.

Dr. Lee: Okay. Any shortness of breath with that?

Patient: Yeah, a little. It feels like I need to take deeper breaths. I’ve also been waking up coughing more often.

Dr. Lee: Any wheezing or noisy breathing?

Patient: My wife says she hears me wheezing sometimes when I sleep, especially in the last few nights.

Dr. Lee: How about fever, chills, or night sweats?

Patient: No fever or chills. I did wake up sweaty a couple of times, but I wasn’t sure if it was the room being hot.

Dr. Lee: How about weight changes?

Patient: I’ve lost maybe 4 or 5 pounds over the past month, but I thought it was from skipping meals at work.

Dr. Lee: Okay, I’ll keep that in mind. How’s your appetite?

Patient: Not great. I don’t feel like eating much during the day. Breakfast I usually skip, lunch I eat light, and dinner is hit or miss.

Dr. Lee: And your fatigue—can you describe how it impacts your day?

Patient: By mid-afternoon I feel exhausted. Even typing at my desk feels like a chore. I used to walk a few blocks after work, but lately, I just crash on the couch.

Dr. Lee: Understood. Let’s talk about your cough again. Is it still dry, or has it changed?

Patient: It started dry. Now sometimes I get this thick mucus in the mornings—whitish, sometimes light yellow. I also feel a tickle in the back of my throat.

Dr. Lee: Do you ever cough up blood?

Patient: No, thankfully.

Dr. Lee: Have you noticed if anything makes the cough worse—like lying down, talking, exercise, or eating?

Patient: Lying down is the worst. I prop up pillows, but it doesn’t help much. Talking a lot in meetings makes me cough too.

Dr. Lee: Okay. Let’s go through your past medical history. Besides hypertension, anything new?

Patient: No new diagnoses. I’ve been managing my blood pressure with the pills you prescribed.

Dr. Lee: Any history of asthma, allergies, or acid reflux?

Patient: No asthma or allergies that I know of. I do get heartburn sometimes, especially at night.

Dr. Lee: How often does that happen?

Patient: Maybe a few times a week. I usually take antacids, and it goes away.

Dr. Lee: Have you had any recent infections—cold, flu, COVID?

Patient: I had a cold about five weeks ago. Runny nose, mild sore throat, but it went away after a few days. The cough kind of stayed.

Dr. Lee: Have you ever had pneumonia or bronchitis?

Patient: No, never.

Dr. Lee: Let’s go over your social history again. You mentioned you used to smoke?

Patient: Yes. Smoked about a pack a day for ten years. I quit five years ago.

Dr. Lee: Great job quitting. Any exposure to dust, chemicals, or mold at home or work?

Patient: Not really. I work in an office. Our house is older though—built in the 60s.

Dr. Lee: How about alcohol?

Patient: I drink maybe one or two beers on weekends. Nothing heavy.

Dr. Lee: Recreational drug use?

Patient: No, never.

Dr. Lee: Exercise and diet?

Patient: I used to walk regularly, but I’ve been too tired. Diet is okay but not great. I eat out a lot during work.

Dr. Lee: Family history—any lung disease, cancer, or heart disease?

Patient: My dad had heart disease. My mom has type 2 diabetes. No lung disease or cancer that I know of.

Dr. Lee: Any recent travel?

Patient: No.

Dr. Lee: Do you have any pets?

Patient: Yes, a cat. We’ve had her for years though.

Dr. Lee: Okay. How’s your sleep overall?

Patient: Bad. I wake up coughing multiple times a night. My wife says I snore more lately. Sometimes she says I stop breathing for a few seconds.

Dr. Lee: That’s important. You might be showing signs of sleep apnea. Do you wake up with a dry mouth or headache?

Patient: Yes, both actually.

Dr. Lee: How’s work been?

Patient: Stressful. We’re short-staffed, and I’m covering extra projects. I’ve been more irritable, and honestly, I feel like my energy is just gone.

Dr. Lee: Any feelings of depression or anxiety?

Patient: I’ve been anxious about my health, yes. Not really depressed, but I feel burned out.

Dr. Lee: Understood. So to summarize:

Persistent cough for about 5 weeks
New nocturnal wheezing and chest tightness
Mild weight loss, fatigue
History of smoking
Nighttime symptoms worse when lying down
Mild heartburn
Poor sleep, snoring, possible apnea symptoms

Patient: Yes, that sounds right.

Dr. Lee: My initial thoughts are that we need to evaluate for several possibilities:

Post-viral cough or reactive airway disease
Gastroesophageal reflux contributing to nighttime symptoms
Possible asthma or chronic bronchitis
Sleep apnea
Cardiac causes, given your family history and chest pressure
Less likely but still on the table: something structural in the lungs.

Patient: That’s a lot, Doctor.

Dr. Lee: It is, but we’ll go step by step. I’d like to order the following tests:

Chest X-ray — to rule out infection, fluid, or masses.
CBC and CMP — to check for infection, anemia, or metabolic causes of fatigue.
BNP and EKG — to assess your heart function.
Pulmonary function testing (spirometry) — to check for asthma or COPD.
Sleep study referral — to evaluate possible sleep apnea.
Consider chest CT if X-ray shows anything suspicious or symptoms persist.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Dr. Lee: In the meantime, I want to make a few adjustments to help you feel better:

1. Continue the nasal spray and start a daily antihistamine at night.
2. Elevate the head of your bed more—if possible, use a wedge rather than pillows.
3. Avoid eating 2–3 hours before bedtime.
4. Try a humidifier to ease throat irritation.
5. I’ll also prescribe a short inhaler to see if bronchodilation improves the cough.

Patient: Will I need to take the inhaler regularly?

Dr. Lee: Use it as needed for now—especially when you feel tightness or shortness of breath. If it helps, that gives us clues about reactive airway disease.

Patient: Got it.

Dr. Lee: Also, since you have heartburn, we’ll start you on a proton pump inhibitor for 4 weeks to see if that improves nighttime cough.

Patient: I’ll try anything at this point.

Dr. Lee: If your symptoms worsen—especially if you develop high fever, chest pain radiating to your arm or jaw, coughing up blood, or severe shortness of breath—you need to go to the ER immediately.

Patient: Okay, understood.

Dr. Lee: Do you have any questions about the plan or medications?

Patient: Will these tests take long?

Dr. Lee: Most can be done this week. The sleep study may take a bit longer to schedule. We’ll follow up in two weeks to review your results and adjust treatment as needed.

Patient: Alright. Thanks, Doctor.

Dr. Lee: You’re welcome. We’ll get to the bottom of this, step by step.
